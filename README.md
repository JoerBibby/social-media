  This is a social media app which has user authentication, profile customization, and a feed of posts which can optionally include an image and which other users can comment on or like. Firebase is used for the auth, file storage, and database, and React is used to build the front end.  

The most challenging aspect of this project was simply moving data around, retrieving data and files in various components asynchronously and rendering them without any error messages. This process helped me to learn the various lifecycle methods of class components and made me much more comfortable working with databases. 

In the future I would like to add friend list functionality, instant messaging, and improve how profile viewing works (currently you can click on a userâ€™s profile picture and a modal opens containing their profile info and a feed of their posts, it would maybe be better to have that in a separate page with react router.
